    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import stdev from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-uniform-stdev@esm/index.mjs';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the esm branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-uniform-stdev/tags). For example,

```javascript
import stdev from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-uniform-stdev@v0.2.0-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### stdev( a, b )

Returns the [standard deviation][standard-deviation] of a [uniform][uniform-distribution] distribution with parameters `a` (minimum support) and `b` (maximum support).

```javascript
var v = stdev( 0.0, 1.0 );
// returns ~0.289

v = stdev( 4.0, 12.0 );
// returns ~2.309

v = stdev( 2.0, 8.0 );
// returns ~1.732
```

If provided `NaN` as any argument, the function returns `NaN`.

```javascript
var v = stdev( NaN, 2.0 );
// returns NaN

v = stdev( 2.0, NaN );
// returns NaN
```

If provided `a >= b`, the function returns `NaN`.

```javascript
var y = stdev( 3.0, 2.0 );
// returns NaN

y = stdev( 3.0, 3.0 );
// returns NaN
```
